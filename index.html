            My name is Isabela, I'm from Barretos (São Paulo, Brazil), I'm 19 and a web developer student at Trybe. I'm interested in this
             area since I was 14 and started a computer thecnician course. </br>
             I like to learn all I can, in different areas, you can say I'm a curious about the knowlodge
             itself. Always looking for new things ˆ-ˆ
